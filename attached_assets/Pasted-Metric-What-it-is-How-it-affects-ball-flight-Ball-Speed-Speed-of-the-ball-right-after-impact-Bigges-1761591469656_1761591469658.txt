Metric	What it is	How it affects ball flight
Ball Speed	Speed of the ball right after impact.	Biggest driver of carry; more speed = more potential distance if launch & spin are optimized.
Club Speed	Speed of the clubhead at impact.	Enables ball speed; efficiency depends on strike quality and delivery (see Smash Factor).
Smash Factor	Ball speed ÷ club speed.	Higher smash = more efficient energy transfer → more distance at the same club speed.
Launch Angle	Vertical takeoff angle of the ball.	Too low/high costs carry; optimizing with spin maximizes distance.
Launch Direction	Initial horizontal start line relative to target.	Sets the starting line; paired with Spin Axis it determines curve back toward/away from target. 
Rapsodo

Spin Rate (Backspin)	Revolutions per minute around the ball’s horizontal axis.	With launch angle, governs lift/drag and carry; too much/too little hurts distance/consistency. (Measured when using RPT/RCT-style balls.)

Spin Axis	Tilt of the spin axis (left/right).	Primary controller of shot curvature (draw/fade); more tilt = more curve. 
Rapsodo

Carry Distance	Distance the ball flies before first landing.	Core outcome metric; driven by ball speed, launch, and spin. 
Rapsodo

Total Distance	Carry plus rollout.	Influenced by descent angle, spin, and surface—flatter descent/less spin often rolls farther.
Side Carry	Lateral distance from target line at landing.	Shows left/right miss pattern; relates to launch direction and spin axis.
Apex (Peak Height)	Highest point of the ball’s flight.	Too low can limit carry/stop; too high with excess spin can balloon. 
Rapsodo

Descent Angle	Angle of the ball’s approach at landing.	Steeper angles stop faster (irons); shallower angles roll more (driver).

Shot Type (Shape)	Classification of the curve (e.g., draw, fade, straight).	Summarizes start line + curvature for dispersion control.

Club Path	Direction the clubhead is moving (in-to-out / out-to-in) at impact.	Along with face angle, heavily influences spin axis and shot shape (draw/fade). Added in 2025.

Angle of Attack	Up/down strike angle at impact.	Affects spin and launch: upward AoA with driver can add carry; downward AoA increases spin/trajectory control with irons. Added in 2025.
