#### 8) First Shots: Practice basics and measured metrics

Copy: Start a Practice session to see real‑time ball flight, video replay, and metrics. RPT balls enable measured spin and spin axis.

Top questions:
- Which metrics are measured vs calculated? Club speed, ball speed, launch angle, launch direction, spin rate, and spin axis are measured (with RPT balls for spin). Others are derived.
- Will I get spin indoors/outdoors? Measured spin requires RPT balls. Indoors into a net is common; outdoors without RPT balls won’t show measured spin.
- My indoor carry looks short — why? “Indoor swing syndrome” is common; speed and carry improve with continued net use. Compare like‑for‑like clubs and sessions.

Checklist:
- Verify space: device 6.5–8 ft behind ball; ~8 ft ball flight to net/screen
- Use RPT balls for measured spin/spin axis
- Start Practice and confirm video/metrics are recording

#### 9) Simulation Essentials (Rapsodo Range/Courses)

Copy: Play 30K+ courses and practice ranges on mobile. You can project or mirror to a bigger screen and tune graphics (LOD) for your device.

Top questions:
- How do I start a session? Connect the device, then choose Range or Courses from Play.
- Can I use a projector or TV? Yes — HDMI adapter (Lightning/USB‑C) or screen mirroring works.
- Is there multiplayer? Yes, up to 4 additional players on Courses; only Player 1’s data is saved.
- Why does performance vary by device? LOD testing sets graphics level (Low/Medium/High/Max) per device to ensure smooth play.

Platform callouts:
- Android: Connect in Local Network mode to access Courses.
- iOS: Courses work via Local Network; Direct mode requires active cellular internet to load a course.

Checklist:
- Connect device and verify strong Wi‑Fi (Local Network recommended)
- Start Range or Courses from the Play tab
- Optionally project via HDMI adapter or use screen mirroring
- If performance lags, reduce graphics via LOD assessment
